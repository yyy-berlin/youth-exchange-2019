* **to do participants**: input from different games(youtube, source, screenshots)
* to do: record audio
* to do: draw visualizations ("round 1")

### Scene 10 - Influencer fame
#### description
* **we need to clearify this scene**
* video from influencer, also a picture of erotokritos?
* edit either news style (comparable to tv news) or youtube-style

#### implementation
* shoot the video according to d. script
* edit video in video software (clearification needed according to description)
* hard cuts (must be visible)


### Scene 16 - Hulahoop
* **we set this scene to prio 1 because if hulahoop/smiley idea, does this work?**
* story is without devices, no projection mapping to keep the style non-digital?
* some hula rungs are held up, bird flys through, rings

#### description
* writes and sends analog loveletter
* how does this go along with emojis? still prio 1?
* acting on stage: person writes, letter appears on projection behind him/her, sound: pen/quill (german: _Schreibfeder_) on paper

#### implementation
* **to do participants**: find video of flying dove with letter (vimeo, youtube)

#### where to search?

**open adjustments**
* is something required for the big final?
