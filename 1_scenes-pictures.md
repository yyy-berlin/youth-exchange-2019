## Priority 1

### Scene 5 - Media incoming message

* someone posts the music
* one or two people on stage listen to it, give thumbs up, on screen the like-counter goes up
* same for a second group 
* after that the like (and or retweet/share) counter goes higher and higher (without further acting on stage)
#### implementation
* post: "check out this wicked song i heared on the street" with illustration of voicemessage or mp3
* same picture with different numbers for likes/retweets
* compile video from single pictures
* add a sound with each count
* addon: sounds within audience, per messages to phones on friends or parents
* **to do participants**: take cellphone screenshots:
    * an empty inbox screen
    * a voicemail is being posted
    * the post gets a like

### Scene 8a - Fighting
#### description
* fighting happens on stage and background
#### implementation
* add voiceovers and visualizations: "round 1" "fight!" "combo" "combobreaker" "boom" "low energie" "hp low" "kill" "double kill"
* **to do participants**: input from different games(youtube, source, screenshots)
* to do: record audio
* to do: draw visualizations ("round 1")

### Scene 10 - Influencer fame
#### description
* **we need to clearify this scene**
* video from influencer, also a picture of erotokritos?
* edit either news style (comparable to tv news) or youtube-style

#### implementation
* shoot the video according to d. script
* edit video in video software (clearification needed according to description)
* hard cuts (must be visible)


### Scene 16 - Hulahoop
* **we set this scene to prio 1 because if hulahoop/smiley idea, does this work?**
* story is without devices, no projection mapping to keep the style non-digital?
* some hula rungs are held up, bird flys through, rings

#### description
* writes and sends analog loveletter
* how does this go along with emojis? still prio 1?
* acting on stage: person writes, letter appears on projection behind him/her, sound: pen/quill (german: _Schreibfeder_) on paper

#### implementation
* **to do participants**: find video of flying dove with letter (vimeo, youtube)
* https://www.maketecheasier.com/5-websites-find-creative-commons-videos/
