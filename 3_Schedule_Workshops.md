## Notes


### Whats it about
* videomapping: show videos of shapeshifters and stage mapping
* stage lighting: use two lamps to mess around

### Presentation
#### Way of working
* workshops as creative board: You give us your ideas, we'll implement them with offer to join us (though workshop times are quite short)
* in every workshop we'll discuss scenes, collect ideas for visualizations and in the next workshop give feedback to the results

#### Pictures/general ideas
* Background pictures: Posh office scenes -> we search and select pictures for scenes
* Whatsapp/messenger screens: Part of the story is supported by Whatsapp/messenger screens -> you'll come up with text and emojis and we'll animate or screenrecord it
* Voicemail and video: We'll coordinate with the story and record videos of erotokritos as professionally youtube as possible

#### From basic to advanced and fancy
* We'll start with basic stuff and if we have enough time
* Basic: Pictures for szenes
* advanced: Animations or a instagram mockup runs on the mobile phones on stage (or fancy fancy)

### first ideas
* cardbox cutouts for phones
* big drawn emojis
* backside: white surface, project emojis on circles
